The project aimed at developing a framework to read and process data available in the
[Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF)][ENDF] format for use in Monte-Carlo techniques for the
simulation of accelerator driven fission machines, and of the related fuel cycle.
We explored (1) development of a common and robust data format to be used with both high energy
nuclear cascade and low energy neutron transport codes/libraries; and (2) developing
fast-yet-accurate sampling techniques for multi dimensional probability distributions to be used in
the simulation of the fission machines.
