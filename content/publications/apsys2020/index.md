The OS load balancing algorithm governs the performance gains provided by a multiprocessor computer
system.  The Linux's Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) scheduler tracks process loads by average CPU
utilization to balance workload between processor cores.  That approach maximizes the utilization of
processing time but overlooks the contention for lower-level hardware resources.  In servers running
compute-intensive workloads, an imbalanced need for limited computing resources hinders execution
performance.  This paper solves the above problem using a machine learning (ML)-based resource-aware
load balancer.  We describe (1) low-overhead methods for collecting training data; (2) an ML model
based on a multi-layer perceptron model that imitates the CFS load balancer based on the collected
training data; and (3) an in-kernel implementation of inference on the model.  Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed model has an accuracy of 99% in making migration decisions and while
only increasing the latency by 1.9 Î¼s.
