Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is critical for their mass deployment and public
adoption.  However, security attacks that violate safety constraints and cause accidents are a
major deterrent to achieving public trust in AVs which hinders a vendors' ability to deploy the AVs.
Creating a security hazard that results in a serious safety compromise (for example, an accident) is
compelling from an attacker's perspective. In this paper, we introduce an attack model, a method to
deploy the attack in the form of a smart malware, and experimental evaluation of its impact on
production grade autonomous driving software. We find that determining the time interval during
which to launch the attack is critically important for causing safety hazards (such as collision)
with a high degree of success. For example, the smart malware caused 32Ã— more forced emergency
braking compared to random attacks, and accidents in 52.6% of the driving simulations.
