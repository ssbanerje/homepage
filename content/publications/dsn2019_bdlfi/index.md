This paper presents *Bayesian Deep Learning based Fault Injection* (BDLFI), a
novel methodology for fault injection in neural networks (NNs) or more generally
differentiable programs. BDLFI uses (1) Bayesian Deep Learning to model the
propagation of faults, and (2) Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference to quantify
the effect of faults on the outputs of a NN. We demonstrate BDLFI on two
representative networks and find that our results challenge pre-existing results
in the field.
