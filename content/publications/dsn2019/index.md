The safety and resilience of fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) is of significant concern, as exemplified by
several headline making accidents. While AV development today inherently involves verification, validation
and testing, end-to-end assessment of AV systems under accidental faults in realistic driving scenarios is
largely unexplored. This paper presents DriveFI, a machine learning-based fault injection engine, which can
mine situations and faults that maximally impact AV safety, demonstrated on two industry-grade AV
technology stacks (from NVIDIA and Baidu). For example, DriveFI finds 561 safety critical faults in less
than 4 hours. In comparison random injection experiments executed over several weeks could not find any safety
critical faults.
