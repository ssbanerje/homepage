Autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is rapidly becoming a reality on U.S. roads, offering the promise of improvements
in traffic management, safety, and the comfort and efficiency of vehicular travel. With this increasing popularity
and ubiquitous deployment, resilience has become a critical requirement for public acceptance and adoption. Recent
studies into the resilience of AVs has shown that though the AV systems are improving over time, they have not reached
human-levels of automation. Prior work in this area has studied the safety and resilience of individual components of
the AV system. However, methods for holistic end-to-end resilience assessment of these AV systems is still non-existent.
This paper presents AVFI (The Autonomous Vehicle Fault Injector), an important step towards constructing a methodology
for end-to-end resilience assessment of AV systems using fault injection. The tool empirically validates the robustness
of an AV system, by introducing faults to test AV resilience in situations that might otherwise be rarely tested.
