This paper briefly describes the design a system that addresses the challenge of scheduling
distributed data-analytics workloads on heterogeneous processing fabrics (which include CPUs, GPUs,
FPGAs and ASICs) in cloud-based, dynamic, multi-tenant environments. To demonstrate the capabilities
of the proposed system, we use a computational genomics workflow that addresses the growing need for
rapid genomic analyses in hospital environments
