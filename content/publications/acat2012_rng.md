Monte-Carlo sampling of two dimensional correlated variables (with non zero covariance) has been
carried out using an extended alias technique which was originally proposed by A. J. Walker to
sample from an one dimensional distribution.  Although, the method has been applied to a correlated
two dimensional Gaussian data sample, it is quite general and can easily be extended for sampling
from a multidimensional correlated data sample of any arbitrary distribution.
