Hardware performance counters (HPCs) that measure low-level architectural and microarchitectural
events provide dynamic contextual information about the state of the system. However, HPC
measurements are error-prone due to non-determinism (e.g., undercounting due to event multiplexing,
or OS interrupt-handling behaviors). In this paper, we present BayesPerf, a system for quantifying
uncertainty in HPC measurements by using a domain-driven Bayesian model that captures
microarchitectural relationships between HPCs to jointly infer their values as probability
distributions. We provide the design and implementation of hardware accelerators that allow for
low-latency and low-power inference of the BayesPerf model on Intel x86 and IBM Power9 CPUs.
Overall, BayesPerf reduces the average error in HPC measurements from 42.11% to 7.8% when
multiplexing events. The BayesPerf accelerator provides 11.8Ã— reduction in power consumption while
adding less than 2% read latency overhead relative to native HPC sampling. The value of BayesPerf in
real-time decision-making is illustrated with a simple example of the scheduling of PCIe transfers.
