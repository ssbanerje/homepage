I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science][cs@uiuc] at the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign][uiuc], advised by [Ravishankar K. Iyer][rkiyer]. I am affiliated with the
[DEPEND][] research group at the [Coordinated Science Laboratory][csl].

I am interested in applying machine learning to challenging problems within the design
and management of workload-optimized computer systems, where static policies (or heuristics) are not
sufficient, and there is a need for leveraging dynamic contextual information. My research has
demonstrated the application of domain-knowledge (i.e., knowledge about software and hardware
architecture) as an inductive bias to machine learning techniques to solve a variety of systems
problems, including heterogeneous resource management, SecOps, distributed failure detection and
triaging, and testing and resilience assessment.

In past summers I have interned at [IBM Research][ibm], [Microsoft Research][msr], and [CERN][].
