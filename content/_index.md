I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science at UIUC][cs@uiuc] advised by [Ravishankar K. Iyer][rkiyer] in the [DEPEND][]
research group at the [Coordinated Science Laboratory][csl]. My research focuses on the design of application specific
computing systems for data analytics workloads (particularly in computational genomics and precision medicine), with
emphasis on the hardware-software codesign at an architectural and OS level. I received a B.Tech. in Computer Science
and Engineering from [LNMIIT][], India.

In past summers I have interned at [IBM STG][ibmstg], [Microsoft Research][msr], [Intel Labs][intel], and [CERN][].
