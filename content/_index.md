I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science][cs@uiuc] at the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign][uiuc]. I am advised by [Ravishankar K. Iyer][rkiyer] and am a member of the
[DEPEND][] research group at the [Coordinated Science Laboratory][csl]. My research focuses on the
design of workload optimized computing systems for data analytics applications (particularly in
computational genomics and precision medicine) using cross-layer optimizations across the computing
stack: application, runtime, OS and architecture layers.

In past summers I have interned at [IBM Research][ibm], [Microsoft Research][msr], and [CERN][].
