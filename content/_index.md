I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science at UIUC][cs@uiuc] advised by [Ravishankar K. Iyer][rkiyer] in the [DEPEND][]
research group at the [Coordinated Science Laboratory][csl]. My research focuses on the design of workload optimized
computing systems for data analytics applications (particularly in computational genomics and precision medicine)
using cross-layer optimizations across the computing stack: application, runtime, OS and architecture layers. I received
a B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering from [LNMIIT][], India.

In past summers I have interned at [IBM][ibm], [Microsoft Research][msr], and [CERN][].
