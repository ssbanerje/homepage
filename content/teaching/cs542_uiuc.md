This course introduces a system (hardware and software) view of design issues in reliable computing. The material
represents a broad spectrum of hardware and software error detection and recovery techniques. The lectures discuss how
the hardware and software techniques interplay; e.g., what techniques can be provided in hardware, operating system and
network communication layers, and what can be provided via a distributed software layer and in the application itself.

The focus of the course is on basic concepts that underly the resilience of computer systems with focus on dependability
including reliability, availability, and hardware and software fault models, redundancy, coding techniques,
signature-base error checking (e.g., software-based control flow checking), processor-level error detection and recovery
(e.g., duplicate execution and comparison), reconfiguration techniques in multiprocessor systems, checkpoint and
recovery (single process and distributed environment), software fault tolerance techniques (e.g., process pair, robust
data structures, recovery blocks, and N-version programming), and finally, network specific issues (e.g., providing
consistent data and reliable communications). The capabilities and applicabilities of discussed techniques are
illustrated with examples of real applications and systems.

The thrust of the course is to learn the aforementioned techniques through measurement and data driven data analytics
for large scale computing systems and applications. We will use data on unexpected system failures and malicious
security incidents to characterize resiliency and provide insights on design of current and future generation of large
computing systems and applications.  We will discuss methods (e.g., machine learning) and tools to perform high fidelity
analytics and facilitate automation of data processing and quantification of resiliency metrics. Examples will be used
to show the benefit of measurement driven analytics and their role in characterizing how system failures and/or
malicious attack impact applications and how resiliency is affected by application characteristics.
