This course introduces a system (hardware and software) view of design issues in reliable computing. The material
represents a broad spectrum of hardware and software error detection and recovery techniques. The lectures discuss how
the hardware and software techniques interplay; e.g., what techniques can be provided in hardware, operating system and
network communication layers, and what can be provided via a distributed software layer and in the application.
